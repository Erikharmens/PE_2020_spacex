        <p>The following information about the Mission to Mars is from the SpaceX <strong>"Making Life Multiplanetary"</strong> webpage. If you want to read more about this, please visit their webpage at:

        <h1>MISSON TO MARS</h1>
        <p>On September 17, 2018, SpaceX announced fashion innovator and globally recognized art curator Yusaku
            Maezawa will be the company’s first private passenger to fly around the Moon in 2023. To date, only 24
            people have visited the Moon, with the last of them flying in 1972. This first private lunar passenger
            flight, featuring a fly-by of the Moon as part of a weeklong mission, will help fund development of
            SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy (formerly known as BFR), an important step in enabling access for
            everyday people who dream of flying to space.</p>

        <h1>MARS ENTRY</h1>
        <p>Starship will enter the Mars atmosphere at 7.5 kilometers per second and decelerate aerodynamically. The
            vehicle’s heat shield is designed to withstand multiple entries, but given that the vehicle is coming
            into the Mars atmosphere so hot, we still expect to see some ablation of the heat shield (similar to
            wear and tear on a brake pad). The engineering videos below simulate the physics of Mars entry for
            Starship.</p>

        <h1>EARTH TO EARTH TRANSPORTATION</h1>
        <p>With Starship and Super Heavy, most of what people consider to be long distance trips would be completed
            in less than half an hour. In addition to vastly increased speed, one great benefit about traveling in
            space, outside of Earth’s atmosphere, is the lack of friction as well as turbulence and weather.
            Consider how much time we currently spend traveling from one place to another. Now imagine most journeys
            taking less than 30 minutes, with access to anywhere in the world in an hour or less.</p>
