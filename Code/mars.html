        <h1>MISSON TO MARS</h1>
<p>On September 17, 2018, SpaceX announced fashion innovator and globally recognized art curator <br> Yusaku Maezawa will be the company’s first private passenger to fly around the Moon in 2023. <br> To date, only 24 people have visited the Moon, with the last of them flying in 1972. This first private <br>lunar passenger flight, featuring a fly-by of the Moon as part of a weeklong mission, will help fund <br> development of SpaceX's Starship and Super Heavy (formerly known as BFR), an important step in <br>enabling access for everyday people who dream of flying to space.</p>

<h1>MARS ENTRY</h1>
<p>Starship will enter the Mars atmosphere at 7.5 kilometers per second and decelerate aerodynamically. <br> The vehicle’s heat shield is designed to withstand multiple entries, but given that the vehicle is coming <br> into the Mars atmosphere so hot, we still expect to see some ablation of the heat shield (similar to wear<br>and tear on a brake pad). The engineering videos below simulate the physics of Mars entry for Starship.</p>

<h1>EARTH TO EARTH TRANSPORTATION</h1>
<p>With Starship and Super Heavy, most of what people consider to be long distance trips would be<br> completed in less than half an hour. In addition to vastly increased speed, one great benefit about <br>traveling in space, outside of Earth’s atmosphere, is the lack of friction as well as turbulence and<br> weather. Consider how much time we currently spend traveling from one place to another. Now<br> imagine most journeys taking less than 30 minutes, with access to anywhere in the world in an hour<br> or less.</p>
